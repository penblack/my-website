  Throughout my journey from scripting exploits to engineering secure systems,
  I've been guided by a simple belief:{" "}
  <span className="text-white">
    cybersecurity should be clever, transparent, and empowering.
  </span>{" "}
  I design tools that turn attack data into insights and help defenders respond faster, smarter, and more human-aware.
</p>

<p className="text-start text-muted-foreground lg:px-6">
  I'm currently building <span className="font-semibold text-white">RedShrew</span>, a modular suite of open-source tools for deception, behavioral telemetry, and threat response. Its first utility, <span className="font-semibold text-white">PhantomKey</span>, plants fake credentials to reveal adversary behavior in real time. Upcoming tools include honeypots, trap-based telemetry, and lightweight alerting; each turning attacker curiosity into intel.
</p>

<p className="text-start text-muted-foreground lg:px-6">
  I aim to make cybersecurity feel less like a black box and more like a clear, modular toolkit. Whether Iâ€™m deploying traps, scripting decoys, or building threat-facing interfaces, I believe security should meet real-world threats with creativity, clarity, and intent.
